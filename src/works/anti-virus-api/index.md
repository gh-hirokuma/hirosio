- `OPERATION` Check up performance and stability.
- `TUNING` Keep an eye on efficiency for the better environment.

## team

`1 developer` `Trello Base Ticket` `Slack Communication`

## my position

`Fullstack Engineer`

## difficulties

1. It takes time because of _one man_ developer
2. Need to think of solution for issues and make a plan because no body knows the answers
3. There's _far distance_ between customers so, cannot meet up face to face.

## solutions

1. Manage myself for time/motivation
2. Use _microservice architecture_ and make it possible to focus on minor concerns, and solve step by step.
3. Share opinions and information frequently on slack.
