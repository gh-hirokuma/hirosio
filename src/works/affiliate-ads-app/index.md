## skillsets

- Development environment is built based on _docker_/_docker-compose_.
- Mostly app is build based on _CakePHP_ and _PHP_.
- Version Management is _Git_/_Gitlab_.

## description

This app provides affiliate ads service like _Google Adsense_, provide some ads selling company products and affiliaters paste ads html tag to their own website. if they got achievement from real customers, they get awards.

_My mission_ is to maintain this ads system and _build new features_.  
Some of _my responsibility_ is below:

- `BUGFIX` If get minor problems, fix them. basically they are not critical much.
- `FEATURE` If new feature required, build it.
- `OPERATION` Check up performance and stability.
- `TUNING` Keep an eye on efficiency for the better environment.

## summary of tasks

- `BUGFIX` Minor changes like that, some of text message are grammerly wrong.
- `BUGFIX` _Pagination_ doesn't work well. once it's built with complicated Javascript, I changed it to use _PHP basic package_ which OSS team tested well.
- `FEATURE` Add search feature as a new feature.
- `TUNING` previously, its based on _Xampp_, I replaced it on _Docker_ for fast provisioning.

## team

`3 developers` `Trello Base Ticket`

## my position

`Fullstack Engineer`

## difficulties

1. _One of member_ is very _arrogant_ and _self-esteemed_, never listen to others.
2. Development environment is based on _Xampp_, and provisioning is _quite time-consuming_
3. Task management and bug tracker are done with _huge Excel file_

## solutions

1. Be _patient_ and _explain well_ to negotiate him/her to collaborate.
2. Implement _docker_ environment in early phase after I join this project.
3. Install and tackle _agile development_ with _trello-like app_
