## skillsets

- Using _AWS Amplify_ for backend server, implementing _authentication_ and _data trunsaction_
- Mobile app is built with _React Native_.
- Version Management is _Git_/_Gitlab_.

## description

This is mobile app project. the app controls _Ble_ devices using bluetooth signals.  
when players touch screen then the device vibrates.

it provides both _iOS_/_Android_ app via _React Native_.  
Backend ecosystem is built in _AWS_ using _AWS Amplify_.

_My mission_ is to design _app architecture_, _cloud infrastructure_, and also build and implement  
Some of _my responsibility_ is below:

- `BUGFIX` If get minor problems, fix them. basically they are not critical much.
- `FEATURE` If new feature required, build it.
- `OPERATION` Check up performance and stability.
- `TUNING` Keep an eye on efficiency for the better environment.
- `INFRASTRUCTURE` Design and build cloud infrastructure
- `APP STORE` Manage app store contents, application, analytics

## summary of tasks

- `BUGFIX` Minor changes like that, some of text message are grammerly wrong.
- `BUGFIX` _Pagination_ doesn't work well. once it's built womplicated Javascript, I changed it to use _PHP basic package_ which OSS team tested well.
- `FEATURE` Add search feature as a new feature.
- `TUNING` previously, its based on _Xampp_, I replaced it on _Docker_ for fast provisioning.

## team

`1 developer`

## my position

`Fullstack Engineer`

## difficulties

1. It takes time because of _one man_ developer
2. Need to think of solution for issues and make a plan because no body knows the answers
3. First time mobile development experience
4. Ble mechanisms is bit complex.

## solutions

1. Manage myself for time/motivation
2. Study _React Native_ and mobile developmeet so hard.
3. Study _Ble_ concept and read a book for it.
