## skillsets

- System development with _Google Suite_ and _Google API_
- The DB is _Google Spread Sheet_
- Making Business Logic Work in _Google Apps Script_

## description

A project to implement e-learning in the Google Suite alone, without using a server, and
It was quite a difficult project, as some parts of it would be easier if we used a server.

_My mission_ is to design _app architecture_, _cloud infrastructure_, and also build and implement  
Some of _my responsibility_ is below:

- `BUGFIX` If get minor problems, fix them. basically they are not critical much.
- `FEATURE` If new feature required, build it.
- `OPERATION` Check up performance and stability.
- `TUNING` Keep an eye on efficiency for the better environment.
- `INFRASTRUCTURE` Design and build cloud infrastructure

## summary of tasks

- `BUGFIX` Minor changes like that, some of text message are grammerly wrong.
- `BUGFIX` _Pagination_ doesn't work well. once it's built womplicated Javascript, I changed it to use _PHP basic package_ which OSS team tested well.
- `FEATURE` Add search feature as a new feature.
- `TUNING` previously, its based on _Xampp_, I replaced it on _Docker_ for fast provisioning.

## team

`3 developers`

## my position

`Fullstack Engineer`

## difficulties

1. it's difficult to make a web app with only the integration of Google's solutions if you're not familiar with the combination
2. data processing is difficult because it is not DB/SQL that you are used to, but DB with spreadsheets

## solutions

1. we got used to the API's specifications one by one, keeping them in check.
2. prevented bugs due to Spread Sheet's flexibility by strengthening the validation

## achievements

`Techniques` `Website performance tuning`
