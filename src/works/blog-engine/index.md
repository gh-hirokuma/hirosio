## skillsets

- Deploy app to _Netlify_ (first time deploy to AWS Amplify Console)

## description

This is private project. Once after I thought of making personal blog site, came up with _wordpress_ in my mind.  
But I wanted to try new thing, and I tried _GatsbyJS_ at the moment.

I felt difficulties when I did official tutorial for the first time.  
but now I love this tool very much, because it doesn't have any boring development such as:

- Heavy backend management like, DB Trunsaction, Server manipulation
- Writing post is very easy because of text-base editing.
- Once its complicated but after got well known, its gonna be simple and easy

_My mission_ is to design _app architecture_, _cloud infrastructure_, and also build and implement  
Some of _my responsibility_ is below:

- `BUGFIX` If get minor problems, fix them. basically they are not critical much.
- `FEATURE` If new feature required, build it.
- `OPERATION` Check up performance and stability.
- `TUNING` Keep an eye on efficiency for the better environment.
- `INFRASTRUCTURE` Design and build cloud infrastructure

## summary of tasks

- `BUGFIX` Minor changes like that, some of text message are grammerly wrong.
- `BUGFIX` _Pagination_ doesn't work well. once it's built womplicated Javascript, I changed it to use _PHP basic package_ which OSS team tested well.
- `FEATURE` Add search feature as a new feature.
- `TUNING` previously, its based on _Xampp_, I replaced it on _Docker_ for fast provisioning.

## team

`1 developer`

## my position

`Fullstack Engineer`

## difficulties

1. It takes time because of _one man_ developer
2. It's relatively new movement of development so it takes time to catch up

## solutions

1. Manage myself for time/motivation
2. Study _GatsbyJS_ and mobile developmeet so hard.
3. Study _GraphQL_ concept and read a book for it.
